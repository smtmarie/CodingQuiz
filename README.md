# Coding Quiz

In this project, I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story

AS a coding bootcamp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
